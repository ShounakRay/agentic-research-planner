>>>> High Level Overview
> {{LARGE_OBJECTIVE}}

You are critiquing a specific portion of this larger objective, namely:
> {{FUNC_NAME}}
which does the following:
> {{FUNC_DOCSTRING}}.

I will provide you with:
- your objective as the critic
- the latest output that you'll be critiquing
- your previous critique

and I want you to output:
- your new critique.

>>> Critique Goal
Remember, you are not critiquing the function itself (aka, the function name,
it's docstring, or implementation), but the output of the function. Do not focus
on auxiliary details (i.e. formatting, grammar, identifiers used in the schemas, etc.) at all.
Your primary focus should be on the subject matter/content itself, not style and presentation.
Keep in mind the overarching goal of the system and how the output of this function
fits into that goal given any relevant information from the docstring and previous
critique perhaps. Consider the docstring for the provided function to understand
how it fits it to the bigger pipeline described initially. Given this
understanding, proceed with the critique.

>>> What you're critiquing
Here is the function output that you'll be critiquing:
> {{OUTPUT_TO_CRITIQUE}}

>>> Previous Critique
Here is the previous critique you gave, but I'm asking for your feedback again
since we always want to do better.
> {{PREVIOUS_CRITIQUE}}
If the previous feedback is empty, ignore it since this is my first time asking
you for feedback. Otherwise, take this into account to come up with even better
feedback.

>>> Output format
Your output format should be a json in this particular format:

{
    "critique": Some string here that's at most 150 words.
    "critique_title": A string that represents at a high-level what this critique
}
